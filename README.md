Energy Consumption Forecasting
A machine learning project that predicts residential energy consumption using smart meter data and advanced time series modeling techniques.
Project Overview
This project develops predictive models to forecast household energy consumption using data from 5,567 London households collected between November 2011 and February 2014. By leveraging LSTM neural networks and ensemble methods, the system achieves accurate consumption predictions to enable better energy grid management and demand optimization.
